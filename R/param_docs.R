#' @param ts_list Named list of time series of class, zoo or xts with time series keys as list names
#' @param access_sets Vector of access set names
#' @param access  The access level of the time series. This parameter is obsolete once the Time Series DB API v1 is discontinued.
#' @param pre_release_access The access level of the time series before the time of release. This parameter is obsolete once the Time Series DB API v1 is discontinued.
#' @param release_topic Topic of the release. For example 'kofbaro'.

#' @param ignore_missing Whether to ignore missing or forbidden time series when requesting time series data
#' @param access_type One of 'oauth' (the default), 'public' or 'preview'. The access types 'public' and 'preview' bypass authentication. Use the access type 'public' to read public time series and the access type 'preview' to read time series previews. Use 'oauth' for authenticated access.

#' @param owner Username of the owner of the time series collection
#' @param collection Name of the time series collection
#' @param username Username of the time series database user
#' @param access_set Name of the access set. An access set is a group of time series for which a permission (read_quota, read, read_before_release, write) can be granted to individual users. Every time series can be a member of multiple access sets.
#' @param access_sets Names of the access sets. An access set is a group of time series for which a permission (one of read_quota, read, read_before_release or write) can be granted to users. A time series can be a member of multiple access sets.
#' @param permission The permission granted to the user for the time series in the access set. Must be one of read_quota, read, read_before_release or write.
#' @param overwrite If TRUE, the existing metadata is replaced completely. If FALSE (default), new fields are added and existing fields are updated.
#' @param skip_check If FALSE (default), the user must manually confirm the deletion of time series.
